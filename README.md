Password generation app launched with NextJS and Tailwind.

This was a great way to test my JavaScript when I first began seriously writing apps - dealing with matters such as filtering characters to be used in the final password, controlling character length as well as the aspect of random generation were great, foundational exercises in bettering my functional programming.
